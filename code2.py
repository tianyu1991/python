##Harold always boasted about his prowess with numbers. 
##So one day Reese challenged him to a problem. He gave Harold 
##two numbers X and Y and asked him to find out the Nth number
##of the series which began with X numbers of Yâ€™s and the following
##elements are equal to the sum of the last X numbers in the series. Help Harold find the Nth number of the series
